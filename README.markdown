## Development - how to get the specs running

Set up a clean Ubuntu 12.04 dev machine

Install curl

    apt-get -y install curl

Install Ruby via this script: https://gist.github.com/3949650

    curl -L https://gist.github.com/raw/3949650/682b20dbb724f05b4d3d965a42dc359ebf623fb8/install-ruby | bash

Install postgres and nodejs

    aptitude -y install postgresql libpq-dev nodejs

Set up a postgres user

    sudo -u postgres createuser -s -P psp

Copy example config files

    cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
    cp config/initializers/mail_chimp.example.rb config/initializers/mail_chimp.rb

Edit them filling in appropriate values

    vim config/database.yml
    vim config/initializers/mail_chimp.rb

Run Bundler

    bundle install

Then run guard

    bundle exec guard

The first time you run the tests they will be quite slow as they are actually hitting the APIs.  After that, VCR will kick in and replay the http responses so it doen't need to hit the network - making it much faster.

Use Unicorn to run a local dev server

    unicorn_rails
